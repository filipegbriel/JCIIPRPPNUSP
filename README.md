# JCIIPRPPNUSP

This is an academic extesion project focused on developing an especific propulsion system for naval model studies.
The propulsion is referred to as "Azimutal", and is able to propel the boat on 360 degrees.
The model boat is called João Cândido, as a tribute to an ensalved marine who commanded the "Revolta da Chibatada", 
a black uprising against the cruel marine authorities.
